## About the project

This project is a web3 dApp built on the Solana network. The premise of the App is quite simple; it is a portal for Seinfeld fans to share and vote for their favourite GIFs from funny moments from the series. However it demonstrates the power of building web3 apps. All the data on this app is stored on the Solana blockchain. The client side then reads this data from the blockchain to display on the App - no API needed. 

The App also has some additional functionality showing what can be done on the Solana network with some basic programs (Solana's version of smart contracts). This allows users to vote for their favourite GIFs (like giving a like on social media) and even send a tip to the user that posted their favourite GIF if they wish.
